# Stock_Price_Prediction_Project

In this machine learning project, it will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. This project will develop into two parts:

First, to learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network.
Then to build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.

Datasets

To build the stock price prediction model, we will use the NSE TATA GLOBAL dataset. This is a dataset of Tata Beverages from Tata Global Beverages Limited, National Stock Exchange of India: [Tata Global Dataset](https://github.com/sharonccs/Stock_Price_Prediction_Project/blob/main/NSE-TATA.csv)
To develop the dashboard for stock analysis we will use another stock dataset with multiple stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Facebook: [Stocks Dataset](https://github.com/sharonccs/Stock_Price_Prediction_Project/blob/main/stock_data.csv)
